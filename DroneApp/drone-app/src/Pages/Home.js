    <p style={{/*"color": "red", "backgroundColor": "white"*/}}>Drone Light Shows are a combination of drones programmed to
        fly in 3D space to make identifiable visual forms.
        To do this an animation is prepared based on the requirements of the client.
        Drone light shows are also an eco-friendly alternative to fireworks.
        Apart from that drone light shows can also be used to deliver messages to a large audience.

    <h2>Pioneers</h2>
    <p>The first heavier-than-air aerodyne to take off vertically was a four-rotor helicopter designed by Louis Breguet. It was tested only in tethered flight and to an altitude of a few feet.
In 1908 it was reported as having flown 'several times', although details are sparse.[12]</p>
